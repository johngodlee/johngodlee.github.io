<h1>Foraging Chicken of the Woods</h1>

<h2>2018-08-25</h2>

<main>
<p>I finally found a chicken of the woods mushroom (<em>Laetiporus sulphureus</em>) and had the time and facilities to harvest some and cook it. I&rsquo;ve seen lots of chicken of the woods in the past, but have always been too busy or have been travelling, so haven&rsquo;t been able to cook it.</p>
<p>I tried a little bit of it first, fried in butter, to see if it made me feel sick as I&rsquo;ve heard that it makes some people nauseous. I think I&rsquo;ll fry the rest of it to be made into breakfast sandwiches, with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise. It really does taste like chicken, very lemony sweet chicken, very tasty.</p>
