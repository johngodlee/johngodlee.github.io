<p>We have a basil plant in the kitchen, bought from a supermarket. They always die, but we use a lot of basil in our cooking and I dislike having to buy a new plant every few weeks. Over time these store-bought basil plants tend to get leggy and thin out. I looked around and found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byoEBdVoVpM" target="_blank">good video on Youtube</a>
 which demonstrates how to take cuttings from basil.</p>
<p><img src="/img/basil/pot.png" alt="Original basil plant after pruning"></p>
<p>The key is to cut just below a stem node, to take advantage of the lateral meristem tissue found there to promote root growth.</p>
<p>I suspended the cuttings plants in water for two weeks on a windowsill, but didn&rsquo;t add any rooting hormone or use growth lamps as the video suggested. After two weeks there was a good amount of root growth on most of the cuttings, ~2-4 cm. Out of 10 cuttings, two died, mainly because they weren&rsquo;t suspended properly in the water and drowned.</p>

<p>Each cutting was planted in its own tin can, with holes punched in the bottom for drainage. One problem with the store-bought basil plants is that they group multiple plants together in the same pot to give the illusion of a lush, full plant. But this overcrowding promotes the leggy growth and eventual death.</p>
