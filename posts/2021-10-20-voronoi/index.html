<p>Voronoi diagrams partition multi-dimensional space into regions, where all positions within a given region are closest to a single point in the multi-dimensional space. Voronoi diagrams are named after Georgy Voronoy, but can also be called a Dirichlet tessellation (Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet), or Thiessen polygons (Alfred H. Thiessen), as the same thing was implemented in different fields independently.</p>
<p>I discovered Voronoi diagrams when researching methods to describe spatial clustering. I wanted a simple single number measure of how clustered together trees in a plot are, so that I could include that metric as a term in a linear model which looked at factors determining woodland canopy complexity.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-spatial-clustering">What is spatial clustering?</h1>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s important to define what clustering is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful to think about the distribution of points by looking at three special cases. The first special case is complete spatial randomness (CSR), where all points are located completely independently of one another. The second is total regularity, where all points are an equal distance from all nearest neighbours, as in a grid or a regular lattice. The third case is clustering, where points are attracted to each other, rather than repelled. In ecology speak, you could say that spatial regularity is the result of negative density dependence, while spatial clustering is the result of positive density dependence. Regularity and clustering represent opposite ends of a continuum, with CSR in the middle, representing the neutral, zero effect. The continuum is bounded at the end of regularity; given a number of individuals in a space they can only get so far away from their neighbours. At the clustered end of the continuum however, I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s a theoretical limit to how strong the positive density dependence effect could be.</p>

<p>This thought experiment assumes that we are sampling the whole population and the whole available space, but in reality, as the negative density dependence effect increases, the population sampled in the sampling frame merely gets smaller, and the remaining individuals get pushed to outside the sampling frame. Similarly, although there is no theoretical limit on the clustering effect, in biology there is a practical one. It is unlikely that the clustering effect among individuals, trees for example, would not be offset by other factors at very close spatial scales, such as the occupation of physical space by their trunks.</p>
<h1 id="extracting-metrics-from-voronoi-diagrams">Extracting metrics from Voronoi diagrams</h1>
<p>On their own, Voronoi diagrams don&rsquo;t provide any metrics of spatial distribution, they are merely a visual representation. From the Voronoi polygons however, we can extract various metric related to the size, shape and distribution of the polygons themselves. This is the focus of my investigation.</p>
