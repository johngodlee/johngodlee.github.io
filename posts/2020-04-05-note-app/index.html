<h1>Comparison of F-droid notetaking apps on Android</h1>

<h2>2020-04-05</h2>

<main>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a better notetaking app on my Android phone. There are <strong>lots</strong> of notetaking apps on the Google Play Store and they vary massively in features, speed, reliability, privacy, and app size. <a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank">F-droid</a>
 also has a lot of notetaking apps and these vary in quality even more, with many being abandoned hobby projects, and some with very niche features. I think that it&rsquo;s important to support free and open source software, so I limited myself to searching for a new notetaking app on F-droid.</p>
<p>I decided to do a comparison of all the notetaking apps currently available on F-droid to find my favourite. I kept in mind things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of last update and compatibility with new versions of Android</li>
<li>Permissions required</li>
<li>App size</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a few features that I needed in my chosen app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain text storage of notes on device</li>
<li>Homescreen widget where I can preview notes and quickly jot things down</li>
<li>Export notes to plain text files, ideally with <code>.md</code> extension</li>
</ul>
<p>I also had a few desirable features, but which weren&rsquo;t an absolute necessity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated cloud backup</li>
<li>Responsive Markdown styling in the note, to add structural aspects like headings with Markdown syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>I searched F-droid and extracted relevant apps by searching for these key terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>note</li>
<li>todo</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>text editor</li>
<li>writing</li>
</ul>
<p>In total I found 44 notetaking apps on F-droid. I excluded apps that only provided todo-list features, because I often want to take longer notes, write letters and blog posts and stuff. Below is a table comparing these apps and their features, as tested on an Android 7.1.1 running on <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank">Bluestacks</a>
 on my Macbook Pro. I just didn&rsquo;t have the patience to install and uninstall each app on my ailing Android phone, but hopefully Bluestacks is an appropriate replacement. While I was going through the apps I found extra features which I have included in the table, despite them not being features I particularly need. When recording whether an app had a widget or not, I recorded it as FALSE if the widget was just an icon which opened the main app.</p>
<p>I tested each app by creating a folder,if possible, and adding a note with the contents:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># This is a note

```
x &lt;- 123
```

It has multiple lines and [a link](https://www.duckduckgo.com)
</code></pre><p>then I added two tags to the note, if possible. Then I tried to export the note to the local file storage and finally tried to set up cloud storage.</p>
<p>Below is the table of comparisons:</p>

<p>The apps which stood out to me as the most polished and feature rich were Writely Pro, Scarlet Notes, Simple Notes, and Omni Notes. Orgzly is good but I don&rsquo;t see myself learning its idiosyncratic ways. Markor almost made its way to being on of my favourites, but it ran quite clunky on my setup.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I&rsquo;m going to live with <a href="https://github.com/BijoySingh/Scarlet-Notes" target="_blank">Scarlet Notes</a>
 for a while and see how it goes.</p>
