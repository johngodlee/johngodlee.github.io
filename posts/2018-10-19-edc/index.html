<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been getting into the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/" target="_blank">EDC subreddit</a>
 where people post photos of what they carry with them everyday, to deal with mundane everyday things. Inspired, I thought I would write about what I carry on a normal workday. I cycle to work about 20 minutes across town. I do most of my work in front of a computer.</p>
<p>First is the big stuff. I have a Quiksilver backpack. I wish I knew what model, but I&rsquo;ve had it so long that the label has come off. I have my Macbook Pro 13&quot; mid-2014 model which I keep in a felt case with a pad of A4 lined paper and a charger. I have a basic D-lock with cable and a helmet for my bike.</p>

<p>Then the small stuff. I have a length of cord where I keep my house and bike keys on keyrings, a 128 gb Samsung USB stick, and a triangular bin key for dumpster diving. I have some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003CQE2M6/ref=pe_3187911_189395841_TE_dp_1" target="_blank">JVC Adjustable Ear Clip earphones</a>
 which I really like, I&rsquo;ve had two pairs so far, over the course of 6 years. I have a 500 ml metal water flask, a cotton pouch for small change, a Parker mechanical pencil, an empty tupperware, a spoon, a wallet clip that I made out of bits of roofing tin, a basic swiss army knife, and because it&rsquo;s getting colder now, lip salve. Additionally, when I emptied out my bag today, I found a piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daldinia_concentrica" target="_blank">King Alfreds&#39; Cake</a>
, a fungus that is good for firelighting and carrying embers. It&rsquo;s very common on the Ash trees near my parents house, which is where I imagine I picked it up. I can&rsquo;t remember when I got it, so it&rsquo;s probably been in there for a few years.</p>
