<h1>Leaf trait sampling protocol for SECO</h1>

<h2>2025-01-22</h2>

<main>
<p>At the start of the <a href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/seco-project/" target="_blank">SECO project</a>
, we had the idea that we would sample leaf traits across our field sites to help constrain models of carbon cycle processes. I wrote a protocol with a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, Matt Rees, with guidance on how to collect leaves from a representative sample of trees at each site, with the aim of calculating realistic community-weighted means of the leaf trait values that would be useful to the modelling team.</p>
<p>In the end, this protocol was only rolled out at a couple of sites in southern Africa, as the project went in a different direction quite early on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to host the protocol <a href="/files/seco_leaf_traits/seco_leaf_traits.zip">here</a>
 so anybody can use it.</p>
