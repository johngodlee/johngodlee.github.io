<h1>An email which tries to make sense of the RMarkdown ecosystem</h1>

<h2>2020-05-25</h2>

<p>I was asked by my supervisor to send out an email with some resources to get people started with writing RMarkdown documents, in preparation for a lab meeting on the subject later in the week. As well as the resources, I tried to shed some light on the confusing terminology behind the RMarkdown ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all,
I was asked to send out some links to resources on RMarkdown and Markdown. In addition to the <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/" target="_blank">Coding Club tutorial</a>
 which I sent a link to last week during lab meeting, here are some other links I&rsquo;ve come across in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">A comprehensive Markdown syntax cheatsheet</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html" target="_blank">RStudio&rsquo;s introduction to RMarkdown</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/" target="_blank">The definitive RMarkdown Guide, by Yihui Xie, the lead dev on RMarkdown</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some definitions of the various jargon terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown - A text formatting standard to add structural elements to plain text documents, adding headers, lists, quotes etc.. Essentially Markdown is just a way of writing. Markdown documents can be written in any plain text editor. Markdown was designed to be read easily both by humans and machines.</li>
<li>RMarkdown - An extension of the Markdown standard, adding many features which allow for writing scientific reports, including the embedding of executable R code. <code>{rmarkdown}</code> is also an R package that provides these extensions.</li>
<li>HTML - The language of webpages. Every website you read (I think?) is written in HTML. RMarkdown can be converted to HTML webpages.</li>
<li>LaTeX - Another text formatting standard which is specifically designed for creating high quality printable documents. RMarkdown uses LaTeX as a backend to convert RMarkdown documents to PDF.</li>
<li>Knitr (knitting) - An R package which takes an RMarkdown document, executes the R code embedded within it, and &lsquo;knits&rsquo; the results back into the document.</li>
<li>Pandoc - A document conversion software which comes bundled with the <code>{rmarkdown}</code> R package. <code>{rmarkdown}</code> uses pandoc in the background to convert from RMarkdown to various output formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, another article for those who are interested on the limitations of RMarkdown, by Yihui Xie: <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2013/10/markdown-or-latex/" target="_blank">Markdown or LaTeX? - Yihui Xie</a>
</p>
<p>This email is written in markdown syntax.</p>
<p>See you at the lab meeting,
John</p></blockquote>
