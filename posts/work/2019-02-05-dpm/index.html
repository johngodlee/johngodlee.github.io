<h1>DIY disc pasture meter</h1>

<h2>2019-02-05</h2>

<main>
<p>Disc pasture meters are used as a method of rapidly assessing grass biomass in grasslands. They&rsquo;re used a lot in rangeland ecology and agriculture, but they&rsquo;re also useful for my work. They operate very simply by dropping a plate of a known mass and area onto a patch of grass and recording the height at which it settles. They require calibrating by clipping the grass below a proportion of the disc measurements, drying it and then weighing the dry material to build an allometric equation.</p>
<p>The basic design looks like this:</p>

<p>I want to use a disc pasture meter in Angola when I go on fieldwork next month, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to take loads of bits of pipe and a big disc in my luggage, which is already ridiculously bulky. So instead, I am trying to design a meter that sources as much of the instrument as possible from easy to find materials in Angola. I have spent a lot of time surfing around on hardware websites and measuring bits of pipe. The most dificult aspect of the design is attaching the free-moving sleeve pipe to the plywood disc. I&rsquo;ve come up with a couple of designs.</p>
<p>The first design uses a section of flat aliuminium in an inverted-T shape which are bolted onto the top of the plywood sheet, then the sleeve is attached to the T section with a grounding clamp used for pipes and electrical wires. This design is good because it reinforces the potentially quite flimsy plywood sheet. I would take the bolts, metal t-section, grounding clamp and the outer sleeve pipe to Angola, and buy the rest of the piping and the plywood sheet while I was there.</p>

<p>This second design doesn&rsquo;t distribute the weight as well, but requires fewer bolts (meaning fewer drill holes) and fewer bits of metal to take in luggage. It uses a base flange normally used to attach a water pipe to a tank. Again, I would buy the flange, the bolts and the outer sleeve in the UK, then get the rest in Angola.</p>

      /></a></figure>


<p>The flange design could potentially be made more sturdy by sandwiching some flat pieces of reinforcing aluminium to the flange and then going out radially in a cross shape to the edge of the plywood disc.</p>
<p>I looked at a number of research papers which used disc pasture meters to see what dimensions and materials they used. I came across <a href="http://phytosphere.com/gear/fallingplatemeter.html" target="_blank">this brilliant website</a>
 which gave me the inspiration for the T-section design. The papers I looked at were:</p>
<p>D.I. Bransby &amp; N.M. Tainton (1977) The disc pasture meter : Possible applications in grazing management, Proceedings of the Annual Congresses of the Grassland Society of Southern Africa, 12:1, 115-118, DOI: 10.1080/00725560.1977.9648818</p>
<p>Dörgeloh, W. G. (2002), Calibrating a disc pasture meter to estimate above‐ground standing biomass in Mixed Bushveld, South Africa. African Journal of Ecology, 40: 100-102. doi:10.1046/j.0141-6707.2001.00338.x</p>
<p>.B. Hardy &amp; M.T. Mentis (1985) The relative efficiency of three methods of estimating herbage mass in veld, Journal of the Grassland Society of Southern Africa, 2:1, 35-38, DOI: 10.1080/02566702.1985.9647996</p>
<p>N Zambatis, PJK Zacharias, CD Morris &amp; JF Derry (2006) Re-evaluation of the disc pasture meter calibration for the Kruger National Park, South Africa, African Journal of Range &amp; Forage Science, 23:2, 85-97, DOI: 10.2989/10220110609485891</p>
<p>ost of these papers used Bransby and Tainton&rsquo;s (1977) design, which suggested the following dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long rod length: 180 cm</li>
<li>Long rod external diameter: 22 mm</li>
<li>Sleeve pipe length: 120 cm</li>
<li>Sleeve pipe external diameter: 27 mm</li>
<li>Disc diameter: 45.8 cm (18&quot;)</li>
<li>Total weight of free-moving parts: 1.5 kg</li>
</ul>
