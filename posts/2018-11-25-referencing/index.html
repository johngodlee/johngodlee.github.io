<h1>A better system for referencing</h1>

<h2>2018-11-25</h2>

<main>
<p>For a long time I was using Mendeley as a way of managing papers and references. However, the last few months I&rsquo;ve found that Mendeley has been getting more and more clunky on my laptop, even with regular updating, and once or twice even doing an entirely fresh install. I also didn&rsquo;t like the idea of things not being in my control. After a recent report that I wrote, I got pulled up for dodgy referencing, this being because Mendeley is fairly inconsistent with how it labels things like author names, issue numbers etc.</p>
<p>I write all of my important work in LaTeX, so I generally exported my Mendeley reference lists to BibTeX files, so I figured I would cut out Mendeley completely and try to just hold my references in simple flat <code>.bib</code> files. Here is a sample of my master BibTeX file, <code>lib.bib</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>@article{brusa2014,
  author = {Brusa, A. and Bunker, D. E.},
  year = 2014,
  title = {Increasing the precision of canopy closure estimates from hemispherical photography: Blue channel analysis and under-exposure},
  journal = {Agricultural and Forest Meteorology},
  volume = {195-196},
  number = {},
  pages = {102--107},
  FILE = {~/Documents/papers/brusa_bunker_2014.pdf},
  DOI = { http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.05.001 }
}

@article{williams2017,
  author = {Williams, L. J. and Paquette, A. and Cavender-Bares, J. and Messier, C. and Reich, P. B.},
  title = {Spatial complementarity in tree crowns explains overyielding in species mixtures},
  year = 2017,
  journal = {Nature Ecology \&amp; Evolution},
  volume = {1},
  number = {},
  pages = {1--7},
  FILE = {~/Documents/papers/williams_2017.pdf},
  DOI = { http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0063 }
}

@article{sahin2016,
  author = {Sahin, C.},
  title ={Comparison and Calibration of Mobile Phone Fisheye Lens and Regular Fisheye Lens via Equidistant Model},
  year = 2016,
  journal = {Journal of Sensors},
  volume = {2016},
  number = {  },
  pages = {11},
  FILE = {~/Documents/papers/sahin_2016.pdf},
  DOI = { http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9379203 }
}
</code></pre><p>Whenever I read an article of interest, or want to save any reference for that matter, it goes in <code>lib.bib</code>. I normally keep notes for the articles I&rsquo;ve read in a separate set of files related to whatever project I&rsquo;m working on, so I search those to find references that I can&rsquo;t quite remember the details of. Papers are all stored in a <code>papers/</code> directory which gets backed up regularly, it&rsquo;s just a flat directory. I suppose I could make it into a heirarchy based on theme, but I feel that would get complicated too fast, for example, if a paper should be included in two themes, or papers should be retro-actively added to emerging themes.</p>
<p>Typing all the BibTeX markup by hand is very laborious. I use Vim for text editing and I felt it was time to learn about snippets, which are just small chunks of customisable text that can be entered into documents by typing a keyword and hitting tab. I use the &lsquo;SirVer/ultisnips&rsquo; plugin, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" target="_blank">here</a>
. An example of a .bib snippet that I use to generate an article template:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>snippet article &#34;Bibtex for article&#34; b
@article{$1,
  author = {$2},
  title = {$3},
  year = $4,
  journal = {$5},
  volume = {$6},
  number = {$7},
  pages = {${8:1--10}},
  FILE = {~/Documents/papers/$9},
  DOI = { http://dx.doi.org/$10 }
}
endsnippet
</code></pre><p>The <code>$1</code> codes are placeholders which are filled by the user, these placeholders can be quickly traversed using <code>C-l</code> and <code>C-h</code>. Some, like the page numbers, contain example text to remind me how to format certain inputs. Here is the snippet for a book:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>snippet book &#34;Bibtex for book&#34; b
@book{$1,
  ${2:author/editor} = {$3},
  title = {$4},
  year = $5,
  publisher = {$6},
  address = {${7:City, Country}}
}
endsnippet
</code></pre><p>Here are the <code>.vimrc</code> settings I have for UltiSnips:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger=&#34;&lt;tab&gt;&#34;
let g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger=&#34;&lt;c-l&gt;&#34;
let g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger=&#34;&lt;c-h&gt;&#34;

let g:UltiSnipsEditSplit=&#34;vertical&#34;

let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=[$HOME.&#39;/.vim/Ultisnips&#39;]
</code></pre>
