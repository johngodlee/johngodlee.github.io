<h1>What XLSForm+ODK cannot do</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making ODK forms with XLSForm for <a href="https://seosaw.github.io" target="_blank">SEOSAW</a>
, as we prepare for a collaborator to set up some new plots in Zimbabwe. I made two forms, one which takes plot information and another which takes stem information. I have some experience setting up woodland survey plots using pen and paper, so naturally I have opinions and vision for what a digital data collection form should look like. This post goes over some of the things I wanted to achieve in ODK, but currently can&rsquo;t figure out how to. I don&rsquo;t know with absolute certainty whether the issues listed below are impossible to solve, but I researched each of them on the internet thoroughly before giving up.</p>
<p>I <a href="/2019/05/05/field-book.html">wrote back in 2019</a>
 about taking notes in the field, and I even had a stab at making an ODK form then. At the time however, I didn&rsquo;t have the motivation to finish the app or overcome the issues I encountered, many of which persist and I encountered again this time. XLSForm isn&rsquo;t a complete programming language, and isn&rsquo;t as flexible as writing an app from scratch. Unfortunately however I don&rsquo;t have a background as an app developer, so I think designing an app from scratch would be out of my league.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p><strong>Including a table as a hint.</strong> One of our questions asks the user to estimate the level of stem decay on a dead tree, using a 1-5 scale. In the SEOSAW guide there is a table which describes how the wood, bark, and branches should appear at each level of the scale, to try to enforce some consistency between data collectors. XLSForm has a <code>guidance_hint</code> field that can provide additional information about a question which is hidden by default but expandable by clicking. I wanted to use HTML or Markdown to create a table in <code>guidance_hint</code> but it seems that XLSForm doesn&rsquo;t support static tables. As a work-around I created an image of the table and used that in the <code>media::image</code> field.</p>
<p><strong>Incrementing a default answer across repeats.</strong> Tags are normally attached to each stem that is measured to allow them to be re-measured later. Normally tags are labelled with integer values, starting at 1 and increasing in sequence to the number of stems in the plot. To avoid having the user type in the tag number each time, I wanted to show a default value that was the previous tag ID +1. This is similar to another issue: <strong>autofill an answer with the answer in the previous repeat</strong>. The DBH of most trees is measured at 1.3 m height, though occasionally some stem abnormality will necessitate measuring at a different height. This means the user has to type in the POM (Point Of Measurement) of 1.3 m every time. I wanted to take the value given in the previous repeat to the same question and use it as the default in the current repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamically build autocomplete list from previous answers in a repeat.</strong> I want the user to input the name of the species of a tree. If an individual of a given species is present in a plot it&rsquo;s likely there will be more. In order to avoid repeated typing, I wanted to create a dynamic list in a <code>select_one</code> question that would take the answers to the same question submitted in previous repeats, but this seems impossible. This brings be onto another issue with species names. In <code>select_one</code> with &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; =  <code>autocomplete</code>, it seems logical that if there isn&rsquo;t an autocompleted match, the user should be able to freely type their submission in the text box. This fails however, and instead marks the submission as blank. I found <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/opendatakit/issues/289" target="_blank">this forum thread from 2011</a>
 which covers the same issue, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like anything was done about it. My workaround is to have an &ldquo;Other&rdquo; option in the autocomplete list. If the user types &ldquo;Other&rdquo; a question below becomes <code>relevant</code>, allowing the user to manually input a different species name. It&rsquo;s very clunky but I&rsquo;ve seen this as the recommended answer on the ODK forums. I found <a href="https://forum.getodk.org/t/generate-multiple-choice-alternatives-based-on-the-answers-in-a-repeat/10269/15" target="_blank">this issue</a>
 in the forums which accomplishes something similar, but in their version the <code>select_one</code> can only be populated with repeat answers if it is outside the repeat. <strong>NOTE: I have since been advised on a way to accomplish this, see <a href="/2021/02/15/repeat.html">this post</a>
.</strong></p>
