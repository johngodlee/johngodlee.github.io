<p>I have discovered a game called Bike Tag. Players photograph their bike at a mystery location and post it online. Others aim to find the spot, take a photo of their own bike as proof, then post a photo of their bike at a new mystery location to keep the game going.</p>
<p>I have seen this game played on regional biking subreddits, e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bikedc" target="_blank">/r/BikeDC</a>
. I also found <a href="https://www.biketag.org" target="_blank">biketag.org</a>
, which aims to collect different Bike Tag games around the world and provide a common interface, but the project is still being slowly developed and has some issues. From the map on biketag.org, most of the existing games are in the USA, but this might be biased by the nature of the platform. I searched around on Google and <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/" target="_blank">Gemini</a>
, but couldn&rsquo;t find any other general resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to play this in Edinburgh when I move back, so I set about trying to find any existing games. Edinburgh doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated cycling subreddit, and there was nothing on the main <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh subreddit</a>
; there&rsquo;s not much other cycling content on there. There is a <a href="https://scotland.biketag.org/play" target="_blank">Scotland Bike Tag game on biketag.org</a>
, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like anybody is playing it. I looked around on the <a href="http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/" target="_blank">City Cycling Edinburgh Forum</a>
 but couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence of an existing Bike Tag game, which surprised me, I would have thought that the tight knit community over there would be into Bike Tag. I did find a thread on the <a href="https://www.lfgss.com/conversations/353455/?offset=500" target="_blank">London Fixed Gear and Single Speed (LFGSS) forum</a>
 however, where the most recent post was only a week ago, and it&rsquo;s been running for over five years! So maybe I&rsquo;ll play on there.</p>
