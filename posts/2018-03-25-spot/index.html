<h1>Spring woodworking in my spot</h1>

<h2>2018-03-25</h2>

<main>
<p>Yesterday I went to my special woodland spot for the first time this year, as the snow has finally stopped and Spring is starting.</p>
<p>I walked through to my little hidden area that nobody else goes to and had the whole place to myself. Most of the time I spent doing some woodworking with wood I&rsquo;d brought from home, a chunky piece of very wet Beech from a friend in the borders, and a length of Ash that had been chopped up during some hedge pruning in Edinburgh. Both pieces of wood carved really different, the Beech ripped a lot and because it was so wet was quite hard to split, the Ash was lovely, smooth and straight grained.</p>
<p>In terms of things I brought with me I had my small hatchet, a Mora utility knife, a spoon carving knife, a blanket and one of those big orange survival bags to sit on and be cozy.</p>
<p>In lieu of a real chopping block, which is something I think I will try to aquire over the coming weeks I found an old dried piece of hawthorn that was split down the middle, which I managed to nestle into the ground so it wouldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>The only thing I wish I had brought was a small foldable saw. I started two spoons which failed purely because I was too impatient to cut through the end separate them from the rest of the ash branch, and they snapped.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;m trying to perfect at the moment and don&rsquo;t know where to start is to get my carving as smooth as possible, like the professionals do it. I think part of it may be the style of knife and the sharpness of the blade. Maybe I need to invest in a little sharpening stone which I can hone things on when I&rsquo;m out and about.</p>
<p>Apart from woodworking I spent some time watching a pair of buzzards harassing crows above my little patch of woodland, and on my way back to the bus in the evening I took advantage of the solitude to pick some Few-flowered leek and Ramsons. They are just about coming into leaf, meaning they are as sweet as they&rsquo;ll ever be; I intend to cover them in olive oil and salt and pepper and have them as a salad next week.</p>
