<h1>Flow diagram for data cleaning process</h1>

<main>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in improving the data cleaning process for the <a href="https://seosaw.github.io/" target="_blank">SEOSAW</a>
 database. I created an R package with a load of data cleaning functions and designed a workflow for ingesting new data into the database. Today I faffed around for a while making a flow diagram to keep track of all the functions.</p>
<p>I opted for a nested function design. At the bottom end there are many functions which do very simple things like check whether a particular column contains the correct factor levels (e.g. <code>diam()</code>). These functions are the nested within a function which checks all of the column contents in a dataset which is to be ingested into the database (e.g. <code>colValCheck()</code>). At the top there are a small number of high level functions which perform the checking formatting and adding new columns all in one (e.g. <code>stemTableGen()</code>). I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is overly complicated or not, but to me it seems reasonably intuitive, made easier with some good documentation. It also affords the user a lot of flexibility in how they construct their workflow.</p>
<p>The idea is the diagram will be hosted on the SEOSAW website along with a vignette and the package manual, as well as on the Bitbucket repository for the SEOSAW dataset, so that users can use it as a quick reference when cleaning their own data, either for inclusion into the SEOSAW database, or for comparing their own data with the SEOSAW repository.</p>
