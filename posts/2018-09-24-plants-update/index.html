<h1>Update on plant growth</h1>

<p>While I was away over the summer I had to send my plants away to be looked after by friends. Now I&rsquo;m back in a new house and I&rsquo;m pretty impressed by how much they&rsquo;ve grown, so I decided to try and take some nice photos.</p>
<p>The <em>Kalanchoe sp.</em> has started growing little plantulitas with roots which keep dropping off, they&rsquo;re very cute.</p>

<p>y spider plant was savaged slightly by a cat, but they&rsquo;re basically immortal. The one I have now is a 4th generation cutting from the original spider plant I collected from the Darwin Library at the King&rsquo;s Buildings about 6 years ago.</p>

<p>y bromeliad is also doing well. It&rsquo;s become more chunky and has started to develop that nice pale flakey coating on the leaves. It&rsquo;s also a descendant of a previous plant, the mother now lives at my parents' house and is still producing lots of babies periodically.</p>

<p>Finally, my little succulent, which I propagated from a leaf has been growing, but very slowly. It seems to have a problem where it gets little white spots on the leaf surface.</p>
