<h1>compInd: An R package for forest tree-tree competition indices</h1>

<h2>2021-05-20</h2>
</div>

<main>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put an <a href="https://github.com/johngodlee/compInd" target="_blank">R package on my Github</a>
 which has functions for a load of different competition indices designed for forest tree-tree competition, which I&rsquo;ve harvested from the academic literature. A lot of these competition indices come from older papers, as times have moved on and this isn&rsquo;t such a popular field of research anymore, but with more and more emphasis being put on long-term forest plot monitoring infrastructure to track biodiversity, productivity, and reaction to climate change, I think it might be time for a revival. In the package repository you can find the package manual and a vignette which describes the behaviour of some of the indices.</p>
